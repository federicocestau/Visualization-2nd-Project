0,Musician's Friend,No link,"Welcome the GigBAR Move to Chauvet's lineup of DJ lighting bars. With new moving heads, we at Musician’s Friend are excited to bring you this 5-in-1 lighting system. It’s super easy to set up, and with all the features the GigBAR Move has to offer, it’s is going to make your DJ sets even cooler.

Rotating, moving heads create an amazing show
The GigBAR Move takes the Chauvet GigBAR family up a notch with brand new rotating heads. These heads add to the derbies, LED washes, laser and strobe effect lights for a complete light show. The heads have a 360-degree rotation with a 720-degree flip. They feature separate color and gobo wheels, and with built-in Totem mode, you can rest assured that they’ll stay focused on the dance floor.

Easy to control in your favorite modes
The GigBAR Move has several options for controlling your show. Each lighting effect can be individually controlled so you can program the show you want. When it comes to performance, the GigBAR Move can be operated in stand-alone mode that’s automated or sound-activated, with the option of using the included wireless IRC-6 remote control or wireless footswitch control. It also has optional DMX for a really individualized performance.

Simple setup for a spectacular show
Since all the amazing lighting features of the GigBAR Move are pre-mounted to a single bar, setup is super easy. Simply attach the bar to the included tripod base, plug it in and get playing. The included carry bag keeps everything organized between gigs. Plus, if you need even more lighting for your show, the GigBAR Move can connect to other GigBAR Moves, as well as the GigBAR 2 in master/slave mode.

5-in-1 lighting bar enhances your set
The GigBAR Move makes it simple to have an awesome DJ set. Whether you use one bar for a small venue or link multiple bars together to make a large room illuminate, it has you covered with plenty of great effects.",$799.99,https://www.musiciansfriend.com/pro-audio/chauvet-dj-gigbar-move-5-in-1-led-and-laser-lighting-effects-bar
